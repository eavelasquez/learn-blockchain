# Learn Blockchain

This is a project to learn about blockchain technology and how it can be used to create a blockchain.

## What is a blockchain?

Blockchain is a series of records, called blocks, stored in a public ledger. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.
